          Americans move a lot. Statistics reveal that Americans move 11.7 times on an average in their lifetime. They move for various reasons â€“ a job change, upsizing to a new home, or just to live in a new neighborhood. It has also been noticed that younger people move more frequently. According to the Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey for 2013, most moves are related to housing (48%), followed by family issues (30.3%), and job relocations (19.4%).
